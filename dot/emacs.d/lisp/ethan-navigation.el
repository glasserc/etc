;;; ethan-registers.el --- Set up registers. Stolen from Emacs-Starter-Kit.

;; Registers allow you to jump to a file or other location
;; quickly. Use C-x r j followed by the letter of the register (i for
;; init.el, r for this file) to jump to it.

;; You should add registers here for the files you edit most often.
